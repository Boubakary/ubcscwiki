> 	The University of Buea computer science programming club, is all about promoting team work, programming and open-source contribution among students of the University of Buea computer science department. 

#### How to get better at programming

There is no better way to improve you programming skills, than to actually write code consistently. Working on competitive programming sites like [Topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com) would help import your programming skills. Also, contributing to open-source would be another great way to learn more about programming. 

#### Importance of contributing to open-source
- Since we all depend on open-source software, contributing to open-source would be one way to give back to the community.
- It is also a rare opportunity to contribute to a software that is making a difference in the lives of many.
- By contributing to open-source we would also be great way to collaborate with, and learn from a team on solving computation problem.
- It also offers a chance to learn from the best and to good gain experience.
